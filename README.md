# Mobile_Apps_Project
This project involved analyzing a dataset of mobile apps to gain insights into their performance and popularity, as well as conducting sentiment analysis on user reviews to understand the sentiment associated with the apps. 
The dataset was merged from multiple sources and included information such as app category, ratings, reviews, installs, pricing, and features. The analysis was performed using Python programming language and popular data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, as well as natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis.

Analysis Steps:

Data Collection:
Multiple datasets from different sources were collected, containing information about mobile apps, including app category, ratings, reviews, installs, pricing, and features.
The datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to remove any duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns, ensuring data integrity for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Basic statistical analysis was performed on the cleaned dataset to gain initial insights into the data, such as calculating summary statistics, checking data distributions, and identifying outliers.
Data visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, and word clouds, were created to visualize the distribution and patterns of app categories, ratings, reviews, installs, pricing, and features.

Sentiment Analysis:
User Review Sentiment Analysis: Natural language processing techniques were applied to analyze the sentiment of user reviews, such as sentiment polarity and subjectivity, to understand the sentiment associated with the apps. Visualizations, such as bar charts and pie charts, were created to visualize the distribution of sentiment across different apps and categories.

Summary:
This mobile app analysis project involved analyzing a dataset of mobile apps from https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps to gain insights into their performance and popularity, as well as conducting sentiment analysis on user reviews to understand the sentiment associated with the apps. The analysis included data collection, exploratory data analysis, and sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis provided valuable insights into the sentiment associated with user reviews, which can help businesses better understand user feedback, improve app features or functionalities, and optimize their mobile app strategies. The visualizations and sentiment analysis results can be used to make informed decisions and enhance the overall performance of mobile apps.
